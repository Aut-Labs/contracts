# ƒÄut Labs - Smart Contracts
ƒÄut is an expandable protocol for Role-based Membership in Web3 Communities & DAOs.

DAOs can be much more than _Smart Treasuries_, ƒÄut introduces native Roles & Interactions directly at contract level, to power the 2nd generation of DAOs. The DAO 2.0s, or a Coordination Renaissance.

To read more about ƒÄut, visit our [Docs](https://docs.aut.id).
Below, you'll find a simple walkthrough to get started using ƒÄut's Smart Contracts.

# Docker Setup

Create docker network (once)
```bash
docker network create mainnet
```

Run local blockchain node & deploy contracts. 
Now the local node is accessable at `http://localhost:8545` (with `chainId=31337`)
The deployer's PK is specified in `docker-compose.yml`
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Run local graph node
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.graph.yml up
```

Deploy subgraphs
```bash
(
    cd subgraphs/aut-id
    yarn create-local
    yarn deploy-local
)
```

# Setup 

## Install Foundry 

### Using Foundryup

Foundryup is the Foundry toolchain installer. You can find more about it [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/foundryup/README.md).

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will install Foundryup, then simply follow the instructions on-screen,
which will make the `foundryup` command available in your CLI.

Running `foundryup` by itself will install the latest (nightly) [precompiled binaries](#precompiled-binaries): `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`.
See `foundryup --help` for more options, like installing from a specific version or commit.

## Deployments
### Deploy Using Forge Script

```sh
forge script  ./script/DeployAll.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --etherscan-api-key $XSCAN_TOKEN --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --verify --broadcast 
 ```

Simulate the deployment locally first by running the command without the `--broadcast` (and `--verify`) flag.

`$RPC_URL` replace with the desired EVM RPC. Private RPC recommended. (Alchemy, Infura etc.)<br>
`$XSCAN_TOKEN` network specific blockchain explorer API key, use to upload ABIs and verify contracts <br>
`$DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` The private key of the deploying account (needs to have sufficient gas token balance)


### Get Artefacts Using Forge

`forge build`
Now all artefacts are stored in the `out/` folder (repository root)

> **_Tip:_** If you're expanding the DAO Types that the product supports, for testing purposes, you can add it to /scripts/deployDAOTypes.js
