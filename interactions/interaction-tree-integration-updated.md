# Interaction Tree: System Integration

## Integration with Existing System

### 1. Key Integration Points

Current Task System:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[TaskRegistry] --> B[TaskFactory]
    B --> C[TaskManager]
    
    D[Interaction Tree] --> |Independent Templates|E[Action Tracking]
    A --> |Manual Addition by Team|D
```

The Interaction Tree:
1. Creates independent interaction templates
2. Tracks actions across chains
3. Exists independently of TaskRegistry

### 2. Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Interaction Creation] --> B[Independent NFT]
    B --> C[Action Tracking]
    D[TaskRegistry] --> |Manual Addition|B
    B --> E[Hub Usage]
```

### 3. Context Integration

Contexts map to existing components:
1. Hub Usage → TaskManager
2. Map Usage → AutID
3. Onboarding → Membership

The system operates independently, with TaskRegistry integration being a separate, manual process handled by your team.

This creates a clean separation where:
- Interaction Tree focuses on template creation and tracking
- Your team handles TaskRegistry additions
- Hubs utilize registered interactions as needed
