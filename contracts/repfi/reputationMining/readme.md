# Tokens

$AUT tokens distributed through Reputation Mining are designed to be distributed monthly (see Distribution Formula) and “vestedˮ for 1 period (28 days).

During the Vesting period, tokens canʼt be withdrawn or sold - but they can, and should, be used within Āutʼs ecosystem (see Token Utility)

We've designed and implemented a novel mechanism for this process, inspired by yield-bearing and restaking asset classes.

This new primitive, which we call c-tokens (conditional tokens), allows holders of a specific token (in this case, $AUT) to use $c-AUT within secure, whitelisted dApps, protocols and DeFi instruments before the actual $AUT amount is unlocked.

If, at the end of the specific period of distribution, the user has "staked" 60% or more of their designated $c-AUT, their c-tokens will convert to actual $AUT and be sent to the user's wallet. Otherwise (= if less than 60% has been used), the amount allocated will be proportionally decreased.
