The tasks module implements a simple State Machine for on chain tasks. 
The state machine has 4 states - Created, Taken, Submitted, Finalized. 
The task itself is associated with Ð° role.
The off-chain data of the task such as description, title, tags etc is represented by IPFS CID pointing to a JSON file. 
Every tasks plugin must implement this interface.
