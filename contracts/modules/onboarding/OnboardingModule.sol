The OnboardingModule aims to give the most general structure for onboarding members.  
The required functions are only two - check if an address has been onboarded, and onboard() function that marks them as onboarded. 
If an OnboardingPlugin needs off-chain flow, like social verification, 
this contract can implement additional functions for this off-chain flow using oracles or backends.
